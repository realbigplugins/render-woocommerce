== Description ==

[Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) is a powerful plugin for selling digital
products on your WordPress website. [Render](http://renderwp.com/?utm_source=Render%20EDD&utm_medium=readme%20link&utm_campaign=Render%20EDD%20Readme
) is a WordPress plugin which makes shortcodes and makes them easier to use. This extension for both plugins takes the
shortcodes created by Easy Digital Downloads and provides an integrates them with the intuitive interface from Render.

Now you can find all the available EDD shortcodes, view and utilize all their available parameters, and insert them
into your content, easier than ever before and without ever touching code (even shortcodes)! Plus, Render enables
live previewing of supported shortcodes in the editor so you never even SEE those ugly shortcodes. Instead, you
instantly see exactly what your shortcodes are returning and are able to manipulate them with ease.

This plugin requires both EDD and Render.

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `render-edd` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
